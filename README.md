## Usage as a Customer

TechCart offers a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the platform. The main functionalities available through the CLI include:

- Logging in as an existing user
- Registering as a new user
- Browsing available products as a guest
- Browsing available products as a logged-in user
- Shopping cart management (add or delete items from it)
- Viewing and managing the shopping cart
- Paying (simulation)
- Placing an order

  ### Example Use Cases
  
**Register a New User**
  To enable all functionalities of the TechCart platform, you need to be a registered customer. This process will create a new account:

   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```

   After launching the CLI, select the option to create an account:
   - Choose option `2. Create an account`
   - Follow the prompts to enter your username, email, and a strong password as per the requirements.
   - The registration process will directly lead you to the logged-in menu with access to more available options.

**Login as an Existing User**
  If you already have an account, you can login to access the programme features such as managing your cart, and placing orders.

   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```

   After launching the CLI, select the option to log in:
   - Choose option `1. Login`
   - Follow the prompts to enter your username and password.
    (only 3 attempts before the two-factor authentication process is launched)
    - The Login process will lead you to the logged-in menu with access to more available options.

3. **Browse as a Guest User**
   If you do not have an account and do not wish to create one, you can browse the products available on the platform as a guest user.

   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```

   After launching the CLI, select the option to browse as a guest:
   - Choose option `3. Browse as a guest`
   - You can view the available products and their details.



## Features

  ### User Authentication
  
  - **Registration**: Users can create a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The system enforces strong password policies and validates email formats.
  - **Login**: Existing users can log in using their credentials. The system includes security measures like rate limiting and two-factor authentication (2FA) after multiple failed login attempts.
  
  ### Product Management
  
  - **Browse Products**: Users can browse available products, view details, and add items to their cart.
  - **Add to Cart**: Users can add selected products to their shopping cart, specifying the quantity.
  - **View Cart**: Users can view the items in their cart, update quantities, or remove items.
  - **Checkout**: Users can proceed to checkout, where the system calculates the total amount and processes the payment.
  
  ### Order Management
  
  - **Order Creation**: When a user places an order, the system creates an order record, processes the payment, and updates stock quantities.
  - **Order Tracking**: Users can view the status of their orders and receive updates as the status changes.
  


## Security Focus

TechCart implements several security features to protect user data and ensure secure transactions:

  ### Password Management
  
  - **Salted Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 with a unique salt for each user. This prevents attackers from using precomputed hashes to crack passwords. The use of salt in password encryption significantly enhances security by mitigating the risk of precomputed hash attacks, such as dictionary attacks. Salt adds random data to the passwords before hashing, increasing the complexity and uniqueness of the encrypted passwords. This method ensures that even if the same password is used by different users, the resulting hash values will be different, making it harder for attackers to crack the passwords (Ebanesar & Suganthi, 2019).
  - 
  - **Strong Password Requirements**: Passwords must be at least 8 characters long and include a mix of upper and lower case letters, digits, and special characters.
  
  ### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
  
  - **Conditional 2FA**: After three failed login attempts, the system requires users to enter a security code sent to their email. This adds an additional layer of security against unauthorized access.
  
  ### Data Encryption
  
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Sensitive user data, such as email addresses and keys, are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm. The system uses a master key to encrypt and decrypt user keys, providing an additional layer of security.
  
  ### Rate Limiting
  
  - **API Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service attacks, the system limits the number of requests from a single IP address. The default limit is 200 requests per day and 50 requests per hour.



## Data Validation

Data validation is crucial to ensure the integrity and reliability of the system. TechCart employs various validation techniques:

  ### Email Validation
  
  - **Format Checking**: The system validates the format of email addresses during registration to ensure they conform to standard email address formats.
  
  ### Password Validation
  
  - **Strength Checking**: Passwords are checked to ensure they meet the required strength criteria, including length and character diversity.
  
  ### Input Sanitization
  
  - **Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks and ensure that data stored in the database is clean and safe.



## Testing

TechCart includes a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system. The tests cover various aspects of the application, including:

  ### Unit Tests
  
  - **Functionality Testing**: Tests for individual functions and methods to ensure they perform as expected.
  - **Boundary Testing**: Tests for edge cases and boundary conditions to ensure the system handles them gracefully.
  
  ### Integration Tests
  
  - **Module Interactions**: Tests for interactions between different modules to ensure they work together correctly.
  - **Data Flow**: Tests for data flow between modules, including user authentication, shopping cart management, and order processing.
  
  ### Security Tests
  
  - **Authentication Testing**: Tests for the authentication process, including 2FA and rate limiting.
  - **Encryption Testing**: Tests for data encryption and decryption to ensure sensitive data is protected.
  
  ### Example Test Cases
  
  1. **User Registration**: Test the registration process with valid and invalid inputs.
  2. **Login Attempts**: Test login attempts with correct and incorrect credentials, including triggering 2FA.
  3. **Shopping Cart**: Test adding, updating, and removing items from the cart.
  4. **Order Placement**: Test the order placement process, including payment validation.



## Potential Future Implementations

  ### Enhanced User Experience
  
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a user-friendly GUI to replace the CLI, making it easier for users to interact with the platform.
  - **Mobile App**: Create a mobile application to provide users with on-the-go access to TechCart.  
  - **Wishlist**: Allow users to create and manage wishlists for products they are interested in purchasing later.
  - **Recommendations**: Implement a recommendation engine to suggest products based on user behaviour and preferences.
  
  ### Improved Security and data validation
  
  - **OAuth Integration**: Integrate OAuth for secure third-party authentication, allowing users to log in using their existing social media accounts.
  - **Advanced Fraud Detection**: Implement machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.
  - **Credit Card Validation**: Implement the Luhn Algorithm (Modulus 10 Algorithm) to validate credit card numbers.
  
  ### Scalability and Performance
  
  - **Database Optimization**: Optimize database queries and indexing to improve performance and scalability.
